I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Campinas (UNICAMP). In my research, I use genomic data to explore the evolutionary history of the Peruvian fur seal, a hybrid lineage, examining the impact of climate change on its secondary contact with one of its parental species and the implications of this phenomenon for the species' future. I have extensive international research experience. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Finnish Museum of Natural History (LUOMUS), University of Helsinki (Finland), with additional research experience at the University of Bergen (Norway), where I studied the phylogenetic relationships of Scarab beetles from Madagascar and surrounding islands using genomics and museomics techniques.
