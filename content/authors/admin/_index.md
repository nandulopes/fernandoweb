My research focuses on understanding the phylogenetic relationships of extant and extinct species of dung beetles from Madagascar and Mascarenes using UCEs and aDNA. In this project, we aim to reconstruct detailed evolutionary dynamics of the stunning dung beetle diversity in the Malagasy region and the associated mass extinction events likely caused by human activity. My research interests are molecular systematics, population genomics, and phylogeography, with particular emphasis on the methods that account for hybridization. Previously, I studied how environmental conditions influence marine mammals' population structure and diversification using RADseq and WGS.
